Open Engineer
=============
I'm [Christian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-schmitz-ba0a23b9/), a Software Developer with a background in Mechanical Engineering.

I started my programming career developing [CFD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics) tools, but have gradually moved on to [Web3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3) related projects.

I'm a big proponent of [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) and share most of my work via [Github](https://github.com/OpenEngineer).

My current backend language of choice is [Golang](https://go.dev/).

Projects
--------

### ComputePortal

*ComputePortal* is a platform with client-side engineering calculators. These calculators support multi-point data entry and have 2d-plotting functionality for postprocessing.

*ComputePortal* makes extensive use of [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org). This has the potential to one day be powerful enough to do in-browser CFD calculations.

### Casperlang
Third iteration of my personal functional programming language.

Properties:

* a pure functional language, inspired by [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
* a focus on simplicity, with a minimal number of language concepts
* pattern matching instead of typing
* dynamic dispatch, allowing OOP-style patterns without explicit language support
* whitespace and indentations are significant, allowing very readable nested declarations
